# Epic_Sumo_Multiplayer
This game was created by @Tucan444 and I added network multiplayer via websockets.

To run it start server.py.
It will only bind to localhost and to bind to other ip change it in the code.
epic_sumo1 is for player1 and epic_sumo2 is for player2
Change the ip in client files to connect to a server.
